## Tezos Sending

This app was built to learn how to use BeaconSDK and other API's that are currently available to send the cryptocurrency (Tezos) to other wallets. It uses Kukaiwallet as a means of logging in and sending to others.

This app uses all custom CSS, written in React.js, and Figma was used for design!
